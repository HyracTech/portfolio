# resume_website
This is a simple example of a resume website for a Computer Science student or entry level developer.

The information technology field is very competitive nowadays and you have to stand out in order to get a chance of landing a good job. Having just a paper resume  and a LinkedIn profile is not enough either. A resume website can set you apart and show your prospective employers some of your skills before you even start the interview. 
This sample resume website gives you a head start at this. Heavily commented and inspired by an awesome theme from http://blacktie.co/2013/10/kelvin-resume-theme/ , it makes it easy for any newbie in the technology field to have an amazing site up in no time.
